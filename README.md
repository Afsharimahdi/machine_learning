* k-NN is used for classification or regression.
* In k-NN **classification**, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a *plurality vote* of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors.
* In k-NN **regression**, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the *average* of the values of k nearest neighbors.
